Garbage Detection Model
This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting and classifying garbage in images with high accuracy. The model is built using PyTorch and achieves a 95% accuracy. This project can be used in waste management applications for automated garbage detection and classification.

Project Overview
The model is designed to classify images into different categories of garbage, helping in the identification and sorting of waste materials. This can be used for improving recycling efficiency, sorting trash, or in autonomous systems for waste collection.

Key Features
High Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of 95%, making it reliable for practical applications.
PyTorch Framework: The model is implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework.
Pre-trained Model: Uses transfer learning from a pre-trained model to improve training efficiency.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
torch==<version>
torchvision==<version>
numpy==<version>
PIL==<version>
matplotlib==<version>
You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of images labeled into different categories of garbage such as:

Plastic
Metal
Paper
Glass
Organic waste
Ensure that the dataset is properly preprocessed before training.

Model Training
The model is trained using a transfer learning approach. A pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG) is fine-tuned on the garbage classification dataset to improve performance.

You can find the training code in the pytorch-garbage-classification-95-accuracy-modified.ipynb file.

Usage
To use the model for garbage detection, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
Run the Jupyter notebook for training or testing the model:
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook pytorch-garbage-classification-95-accuracy-modified.ipynb
To test the model on a new image:
python
Copy
Edit
# Load the trained model
model = torch.load('path_to_saved_model.pth')
model.eval()

# Load the image and preprocess it
image = Image.open('path_to_image.jpg')
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor()])
input_image = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)

# Predict the class
output = model(input_image)
_, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
print('Predicted class:', predicted.item())
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test set. Below are some sample predictions made by the model:

Image	Predicted Class
Sample Image 1	Plastic
Sample Image 2	Glass
